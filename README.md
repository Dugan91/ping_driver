# ping_driver

This repository holds drivers to interface Ohio State's Underwater Robotics Team's Systems with the Blue Robotics Ping device.

## Requirements to Run

To run this node, you first have to set up a ROS workspace. Inside that workspace, you can then create a src folder. Inside that src folder, you can clone this repository. catkin_make will be run outside that src folder. 

As far as requirements, you will first need Blue Robotics's Ping Python Library. Installation instructions are located at https://pypi.org/project/bluerobotics-ping/. We used pip, but many different options exist.
